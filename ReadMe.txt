This folder contains experimental code for the replication of Vogel, E. K., & Machizawa, M. G. (2004). Neural activity predicts individual differences in visual working memory capacity. Nature, 428(6984), 748–751.

IMPORTANT!
1. Ensure that the paths in master.m are correct.
2. Verify that the screen resolution and refresh rate are set correctly in /funs/screenParams.m.
3. Double-check that p.dist and p.width are set correctly in /eyemovement_update/Preferences.m.
4. Confirm that equipment.viewDist and equipment.ppm are set correctly in /funs/EEGManyLabs_CDA_18_7_2022.m.
5. Verify the proper configuration for sending EEG and ET triggers in /eyemovement_update/eyeMovementMeasure_2.m, /funs/EEGManyLabs_CDA_18_7_2022.m and /funs/Resting_EEG.m.
6. Please note that subject IDs MUST consist of 2 numbers (e.g., 01, 02, …, 10, 11, etc.)
